Subject: Current MVP Status, Solution Overview, and Next Steps Toward Production  

Hi team,  

In summary, the current MVP was intentionally built using only technologies confirmed to exist on the corporate network—specifically GPT-OSS—to ensure immediate compatibility and compliance. Because the availability of more advanced agentic frameworks is still unclear, this first release uses a straightforward prompt/context engineering approach that can be safely deployed now and later extended. Once corporate API credentials for GPT-OSS access are issued, the MVP can function fully within the network. Moving to production will focus on scaling, governance, and integration with approved enterprise systems and web technologies.  

## Solution Overview  

### What It Does  
The AI Intake Assistant streamlines GenAI idea submission through conversational intelligence and structured automation.  

Core Capabilities:  
- Conversational Question Flow: Guides users through 10 structured questions to collect GenAI idea details  
- Intelligent Follow-ups: Uses AI to generate contextual follow-up questions when responses need clarification  
- Duplicate Detection: Employs semantic similarity matching using embeddings to identify duplicate ideas (>90% accuracy)  
- Idea Classification: Categorizes ideas into four complexity levels — Simple GenAI, GenAI with Tools, Agentic AI, and Multi-Agent Systems  
- Form Generation: Auto-generates Wells Fargo intake forms in both PDF and Word formats  
- Decision Logging: Maintains a complete audit trail of all AI decisions for transparency and compliance  

Key Metrics:  
- Average Completion Time: 10–15 seconds per AI interaction (optimized)  
- Question Sequence: Static 10-question flow (Q1–Q10)  
- Follow-up Limit: Maximum of 2 follow-ups per question  
- Duplicate Detection Accuracy: >90% via semantic embeddings  
- User Interface: WCAG 2.1 AA accessible and mobile responsive  

## Technical Approach  

### 1. Prompt Engineering  
The core logic relies on carefully crafted prompts for each AI interaction.  

**Question Generation (Follow-ups)**  
System Role: “You are helping collect information for a GenAI idea. Generate a follow-up question based on the context provided.”  

Context Provided:  
- Previous Q&A history (last 6 messages for efficiency)  
- Current question criteria (what we need to know)  
- User’s incomplete response  
- Missing criteria identified  

Output: A natural, contextual follow-up question (1–2 sentences).  

**Criteria Validation**  
System Role: “Evaluate if the user’s response meets all specified criteria.”  

Context Provided:  
- The question asked  
- User’s response  
- Required criteria checklist  
- Example of a good response  

Output: JSON with met/missing criteria and reasoning.  

**Idea Classification**  
System Role: “Classify this GenAI idea into one of four complexity categories.”  

Categories:  
1. Simple GenAI (basic prompt-response)  
2. GenAI with Tools (LLM with function calling)  
3. Agentic AI (single autonomous agent)  
4. Multi-Agent System (multiple cooperating agents)  

Output: JSON with category, confidence score, and reasoning.  

### 2. Context Engineering  
The system manages conversation context efficiently.  
- Conversation History Limiting: Only the last six messages are sent to the LLM to optimize performance  
- Static Question Sequence: Fixed Q1–Q10 structure eliminates topic drift and reduces processing time  
- Conditional AI Usage: AI is only invoked when validation fails or a user indicates uncertainty, reducing cost and latency  

## Current Implementation  

- Solution Type: Prompt and context engineering; deterministic and auditable (no autonomous agents)  
- Modes Supported:  
  - Static: Fully offline, zero-cost mode  
  - OpenAI: Cloud-based LLM mode (requires external API access)  
  - Ollama (GPT-OSS): Local open-source AI mode for secure corporate environments  
- Core Functions: Ten-question conversational intake, contextual follow-ups, criteria validation, field mapping, classification, duplicate detection, and recommendation generation  
- Outputs: PDF and CSV submissions; structured audit logs for every AI decision  
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and mobile optimization

This stack was intentionally chosen to minimize infrastructure dependencies, ensuring compatibility with the corporate network and immediate deployability.

## Corporate Network Considerations  

- The corporate network includes a GPT-OSS model that supports API-based access for AI inference  
- The current MVP was intentionally developed using only the most minimal and known technologies available on the corporate network, which is why GPT-OSS was selected  
- At this time, it is not yet clear what agentic or orchestration frameworks are approved or available within the corporate environment  
- For that reason, the MVP deliberately uses prompt engineering and context engineering instead of a more complex agentic architecture, ensuring predictable, compliant, and easily deployable behavior  
- The current prototype is already compatible with the GPT-OSS deployment and can operate fully within the corporate network once corporate API credentials and access approvals are issued  

## Why a Production Implementation Is Needed  

1. Reliability and Scale: Transition from local file-based storage to a managed, transactional system that can support concurrent usage and enterprise reliability  
2. Compliance and Governance: Introduce centralized logging, retention policies, redaction controls, and evidence verification to meet corporate audit and compliance standards  
3. Architecture Separation: Move toward a service-based backend that manages orchestration, validation, exemplars, evidence verification, and retrieval independently from the frontend  
4. Configuration Management: Implement version-controlled onboarding files so new forms, criteria, and validation rules can be added or updated without code changes  
5. Integration Flexibility: Ensure interoperability with corporate identity, document management, and reporting systems  

## Production Readiness Requirements  

1. Hosting Environment: Deployed within a corporate-approved environment with internal DNS, SSL, and network access controls  
2. Frontend Integration: Production deployments may leverage corporate-approved web frameworks and technologies to align with existing UI/UX standards  
3. Authentication & Access: Integration with corporate identity providers for authentication, authorization, and audit linkage  
4. Data Platform: Enterprise-grade persistence for forms, sessions, and audit logs, including data backup and retention policies  
5. Evidence Handling: Internal document storage with secure upload, versioning, and access control  
6. API and Services: Clearly defined API interfaces to handle data submission, validation, and form retrieval  
7. Monitoring and Observability: Enterprise-level logging, metrics, and alerting for uptime and performance  
8. Security and Compliance: Encryption at rest and in transit, access control, and adherence to internal data privacy and governance requirements  
9. Governance: Formal versioning, schema validation, and change management for onboarding forms and validation rules
