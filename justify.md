Justification:
As part of my role as Principal Engineer focusing on AI/ML and agentic development, I would like to request a Mac laptop in place of the standard-issued PC. While most of the platforms and services I will access are cloud-based and remote, having a development environment that best aligns with my skills and workflows will significantly increase productivity.

MacOS provides a native Unix-based environment, which makes it highly compatible with the tools, frameworks, and libraries frequently used in AI/ML engineering and agentic development (such as Python, Docker, and various open-source utilities). This reduces the overhead of managing compatibility issues that often arise in Windows environments and allows for faster setup and iteration.

In addition, I have extensive prior experience developing on Mac systems. It is the platform I am most comfortable and efficient with, which will reduce ramp-up time, minimize context switching, and allow me to focus on delivering technical outcomes more quickly. A Mac would therefore provide both immediate and long-term productivity benefits.

Providing a Mac laptop will ensure that I am working in the environment best suited to my expertise, which supports the companyâ€™s investment in my role and helps accelerate delivery on high-priority AI/ML initiatives.
