## Module 1: Overview - Understanding Problem Framing for GenAI & Agents

### What is GenAI Problem Framing?

Problem framing is the process of analyzing a business problem to determine whether and how AI can solve it effectively. This is a critical business decision that affects ROI, resource allocation, and project success.

**Key Business Insight:**
> "The most expensive AI mistake is building the wrong solution. Proper problem framing ensures you're solving the right problem with the right approach before investing significant resources." - Technology Strategy Leader

### The Evolution: From GenAI to Agentic AI

Modern AI solutions exist on a spectrum of capabilities and complexity:

| Capability Level | What It Does | Business Example | When to Use |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Simple GenAI** | Creates content in one step | Generate product description from bullet points | Content creation, basic summarization |
| **Conversational GenAI** | Multi-turn dialogue | Customer service chatbot answering questions | Customer support, Q&A systems |
| **GenAI + Tools** | Accesses specific data sources | Answer questions by checking your database | Information retrieval with known sources |
| **Agentic AI** | Multi-step reasoning with multiple tools | Analyze project proposals across departments to find duplicates | Complex workflows, multi-system orchestration |
| **Multi-Agent Systems** | Multiple specialized AI agents working together | Complete business process automation with different experts | Enterprise-wide process transformation |

### Why This Matters for Business

Understanding the AI solution spectrum helps you:

- **Avoid Over-Engineering**: Don't build an expensive agentic system when simple GenAI would work
- **Avoid Under-Engineering**: Don't expect simple GenAI to solve complex multi-system problems
- **Set Realistic Budgets**: More complex solutions cost more to build and operate
- **Plan Appropriate Timelines**: Agentic solutions take longer to develop and test
- **Align Stakeholder Expectations**: Different approaches deliver different capabilities

### The Three-Step Business Framework

GenAI and Agentic AI problem framing consists of three business-focused steps:

1. **Determining the right level of AI solution** for your business problem and expected ROI
2. **Identifying required business systems and data sources** the solution must access
3. **Defining clear business success metrics** that justify the investment

## Module 3: Deep Dive - Semantic Project De-duplication Use Case

### The Business Problem: Duplicate Innovation Investments

**Scenario**: 
A large organization with multiple departments and global teams encourages innovation. Developers and teams submit project proposals for new initiatives. Each proposal includes:

- **Project Overview**: Description of what they want to build
- **Objectives**: What they're trying to achieve
- **Problem Statement**: What business problem they're solving
- **Expected Outcomes**: What success looks like
- **Success Metrics**: How they'll measure impact
- **Technology Approach**: Tools and platforms they'll use
- **Timeline and Resources**: What they need

**The Business Challenge**:

Over 12 months, the organization receives 500+ project proposals. Leadership discovers:

- **23% of projects are semantically duplicate**: Different teams proposing similar solutions to similar problems using different language
- **$2.3M wasted annually** on redundant projects
- **Missed collaboration opportunities**: Teams working in silos on similar challenges
- **Resource inefficiency**: Duplicative work across departments
- **Inconsistent technology choices**: Multiple teams building similar capabilities on different platforms

**Real Examples of Semantic Duplicates**:

| Proposal A | Proposal B | Why They're Duplicates |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Title**: "Customer Feedback Analysis Platform"<br>**Problem**: "We need to understand customer sentiment from support tickets"<br>**Approach**: "Use NLP to analyze support conversations" | **Title**: "Support Ticket Intelligence System"<br>**Problem**: "Support team can't identify trending customer issues"<br>**Approach**: "Apply sentiment analysis to customer communications" | Same problem (understanding customer feedback), same technology (NLP/sentiment analysis), different wording |
| **Title**: "Automated Document Processing for HR"<br>**Problem**: "HR spends 20 hours/week manually processing resumes"<br>**Approach**: "Build ML system to extract resume data" | **Title**: "Resume Screening Acceleration Tool"<br>**Problem**: "Slow candidate screening process bottlenecks hiring"<br>**Approach**: "Use AI to parse and categorize applications" | Same domain (HR), same problem (resume processing), same technology (ML extraction), different framing |
| **Title**: "Inventory Optimization Engine"<br>**Problem**: "Warehouses have too much stock of slow-moving items"<br>**Approach**: "Predictive analytics for demand forecasting" | **Title**: "Smart Stock Management System"<br>**Problem**: "Reduce inventory carrying costs"<br>**Approach**: "ML-based demand prediction" | Same goal (inventory optimization), same method (demand forecasting), different emphasis |

### Why Traditional Approaches Fail

| Approach | Why It Doesn't Work | Business Impact |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Manual Review** | Reviewers can't remember 500 proposals or spot semantic similarities | Duplicates slip through, inconsistent reviews |
| **Keyword Matching** | "Customer Feedback Analysis" ≠ "Support Ticket Intelligence" in keyword search | Misses most semantic duplicates |
| **Rules-Based** | Can't capture nuance: "sentiment analysis" = "understanding customer feelings" | Too many false negatives |
| **Traditional ML** | Needs thousands of labeled examples of duplicate proposals | No training data available, can't generalize |
| **Simple GenAI** | Can't access multiple proposal databases across departments | Only works on provided text, can't search systems |

### Why This Requires Agentic AI

**Semantic Understanding**: The agent must understand that:
- "Customer sentiment" = "Customer feedback" = "Customer satisfaction analysis"
- "Predictive analytics" = "Forecasting" = "Demand prediction"
- "HR automation" = "Recruitment efficiency" = "Hiring acceleration"

**Multi-System Access**: The agent must search:
- Project proposal database (corporate system)
- Department-specific tracking tools (Jira, Asana, Monday.com)
- Completed project archives (SharePoint, Google Drive)
- Technology inventory system (what's already built)
- Budget allocation records (what's been funded)

**Adaptive Reasoning**: The agent must:
- Determine which fields are most important for comparison
- Adapt similarity thresholds based on context
- Consider project stage (some duplicates are intentional pilots)
- Understand domain context (e-commerce vs. manufacturing projects differ)
- Flag potential collaboration opportunities, not just duplicates

**Multi-Step Workflow**: The agent must:
1. Extract key concepts from new proposal
2. Search all relevant systems for similar projects
3. Perform semantic similarity analysis
4. Consider business context (department, budget, timeline)
5. Generate comparison report
6. Make recommendation (duplicate, similar, or unique)

### The Agentic Solution Architecture

#### High-Level Business Workflow

```

- Request more differentiation
```

#### Systems Integration via MCP

The agent connects to your business systems through standardized MCP connectors:

**MCP Connectors Required**:
1. **Project Database MCP**: Access corporate project tracking system
2. **Jira/Asana MCP**: Query department-specific project tools
3. **Google Workspace MCP**: Search proposal documents in Drive
4. **SharePoint MCP**: Access archived project documentation
5. **Technology Inventory MCP**: Check existing solutions
6. **Budget System MCP**: Understand funding allocations

**Data Flow Example**:
- Agent receives new proposal: "AI-powered customer service chatbot"
- Queries Project Database: Finds 3 customer service projects
- Searches Google Drive: Locates 12 proposal documents mentioning "chatbot" or "customer service"
- Checks Jira: Identifies 2 active projects in customer support domain
- Reviews Tech Inventory: Discovers existing chatbot platform in different division
- Accesses Budget System: Sees $500K already allocated to similar initiative

#### Semantic Similarity Analysis

**How the Agent Determines Similarity**:

The agent analyzes multiple dimensions:

| Dimension | How Agent Analyzes | Business Impact |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Problem Space** | Compares problem statements semantically | Identifies if solving same business pain |
| **Technology Approach** | Evaluates technical methods and tools | Spots redundant technical investments |
| **Expected Outcomes** | Analyzes success metrics and goals | Reveals overlapping value propositions |
| **Target Users** | Examines beneficiaries and use cases | Uncovers serving same customer needs |
| **Department/Domain** | Considers organizational context | Accounts for legitimate parallel efforts |

**Similarity Scoring Framework**:

The agent produces a multi-dimensional similarity assessment:

```
Overall Similarity: 85%

Breakdown:
- Problem Statement Similarity: 92%
  "Both addressing customer support efficiency"
  
- Technology Approach Similarity: 88%
  "Both using conversational AI and NLP"
  
- Expected Outcome Similarity: 78%
  "Both targeting 40-60% ticket deflection"
  
- Target User Similarity: 95%
  "Both targeting customer service department"
  
- Domain Context: Same (Customer Service)
  
Recommendation: HIGH DUPLICATE RISK
Suggest: Merge proposals or coordinate implementation
```

#### Agent Reasoning Process

**Step 1: Understanding the New Proposal**

When a new proposal arrives, the agent thinks:

*"I need to understand what this project is really about. Let me extract the core elements:*
- *What problem are they solving? (Customer support inefficiency)*
- *How are they solving it? (AI chatbot with NLP)*
- *What's the expected outcome? (60% ticket deflection)*
- *Who benefits? (Customer service team)*
- *What technology? (Conversational AI, GPT-4, integration with CRM)*

*Now I should search for anything similar across all our systems."*

**Step 2: Multi-System Search Strategy**

*"I'll search strategically:*
- *First, check active projects in the project database - highest priority*
- *Then search archived projects - might be something we tried before*
- *Look in departmental tools - teams might be working on this locally*
- *Check the technology inventory - maybe we already have this capability*
- *Review recent budget allocations - someone might have funded this already"*

**Step 3: Semantic Matching**

*"I found 8 potential matches. Let me analyze each:*

*Match 1: 'Customer Support Automation Initiative'*
- *Problem: Very similar (support efficiency)*
- *Technology: Nearly identical (AI chatbot)*
- *Department: Same (Customer Service)*
- *Status: Active, 60% complete*
- *Assessment: STRONG DUPLICATE - 92% similarity*

*Match 2: 'Sales Assistant AI Tool'*
- *Problem: Different (sales vs. support)*
- *Technology: Similar (conversational AI)*
- *Department: Different (Sales)*
- *Assessment: DIFFERENT USE CASE - 45% similarity*

*Match 3: 'Support Ticket Categorization System'*
- *Problem: Related but narrower scope*
- *Technology: Overlapping (NLP but not conversational)*
- *Status: Completed 6 months ago*
- *Assessment: POTENTIAL COLLABORATION - 65% similarity"*

**Step 4: Business Context Consideration**

*"Before making my recommendation, I need to consider:*
- *Is Match 1 in a different region? (Could be intentional parallel)*
- *Does the new proposal have unique elements? (Different CRM integration)*
- *What's the project stage? (New proposal vs. existing 60% complete)*
- *Budget implications? (New proposal requests $400K, existing has $350K)*
- *Strategic reasons for redundancy? (Backup/competition/learning)"*

**Step 5: Recommendation Generation**

The agent generates a business-focused report:

**Business Planning Question**: "Which systems are must-have vs. nice-to-have for MVP?"

### Step 3: Define Business Success Metrics

Success metrics must connect AI performance to business outcomes.

#### Metrics Framework

**Avoid Technical-Only Metrics**:
- ❌ "95% accuracy" - What does accuracy mean for the business?
- ❌ "2-second response time" - How does this improve outcomes?
- ❌ "Processed 10,000 requests" - Did this create business value?

**Focus on Business Impact Metrics**:
- ✅ "Reduced duplicate project funding by $2M annually"
- ✅ "Decreased proposal review time from 3 hours to 15 minutes"
- ✅ "Enabled 45 cross-team collaborations, saving $800K"

#### Success Metrics Template

| Metric Category | Example Metrics | Target | Measurement Method |
|----------------|----------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Cost Savings** | Duplicate project spending avoided | $2M/year | Track prevented funding |
| **Time Efficiency** | Proposal review time reduction | 70% faster | Time tracking comparison |

| **Revenue Impact** | Faster time to market for innovations | 3 months faster | Project timeline analysis |
| **Resource Optimization** | Innovation budget utilization improvement | 85% efficiency | Budget allocation review |
| **Strategic Alignment** | Collaboration opportunities identified | 40+ cases/year | Partnership tracking |

#### Setting Realistic Targets

**Conservative Approach** (Recommended for First Implementation):

```
Year 1 Targets:
- Duplicate Detection: 75% (vs. current 15%)
- Cost Avoidance: $1.5M (vs. potential $2.3M)
- Review Time: 60% reduction (vs. ambitious 80%)
- User Adoption: 80% of reviewers using system

Rationale: Under-promise, over-deliver. Build confidence.
```

**Aggressive Approach** (For Organizations with AI Experience):

```
Year 1 Targets:
- Duplicate Detection: 90%
- Cost Avoidance: $2.2M
- Review Time: 80% reduction
- User Adoption: 95%

Rationale: Organization has track record, resources committed.
```

#### Failure Criteria

Define what would constitute failure (important for decision-making):

| Failure Indicator | Threshold | Action if Crossed |
|------------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Low Accuracy** | <60% duplicate detection | Pause rollout, investigate root cause |
| **High False Positives** | >25% incorrect flags | Adjust thresholds, add human review layer |
| **Poor Adoption** | <50% reviewers using | Revisit UX, add training, gather feedback |
| **No Cost Savings** | <$500K savings in Year 1 | Re-evaluate business case, consider pivot |
| **User Dissatisfaction** | <3.0/5 satisfaction | Major redesign required |

### Step 4: Choose Implementation Approach

Different AI solutions require different implementation strategies.

#### Implementation Approach Matrix

| Solution Type | Typical Timeline | Key Decisions | Critical Success Factors |

## Conclusion: Making the Right AI Investment Decision

The decision to invest in AI—whether Simple GenAI or Agentic AI—should be driven by clear business value, not technology trends.

**Key Questions to Answer**:

1. **Value**: Is the business problem worth >$500K/year to solve?
2. **Complexity**: Does solving it require multiple systems and adaptive reasoning?
3. **Readiness**: Do we have the data, systems, and organizational readiness?
4. **Resources**: Can we commit appropriate budget and timeline?
5. **Commitment**: Do we have executive sponsorship and user buy-in?

If you answer "yes" to all five for a complex problem like semantic de-duplication, Agentic AI is likely the right path.

If you answer "no" to several, consider:
- Simpler AI solution (GenAI with Tools)
- Non-AI solution (process improvement, traditional software)
- Delay until readiness improves

**The Bottom Line**:

AI is a powerful tool, but like any tool, it must be matched to the job. Thoughtful problem framing—understanding what you're solving, why it matters, and what approach fits—is the foundation of successful AI implementation.

Start with the business problem, not the technology. 
Define success before building anything.
Match solution complexity to problem complexity.
Measure, learn, and iterate.

The organizations that succeed with AI are those that frame problems well, set realistic expectations, and execute with discipline. The technology is ready—the question is whether your organization is ready to use it wisely.
