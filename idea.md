## Module 1: Overview - Understanding Problem Framing for GenAI & Agents

### What is GenAI Problem Framing?

Problem framing is the process of analyzing a business problem to determine whether and how AI can solve it effectively. This is a critical business decision that affects ROI, resource allocation, and project success.

**Key Business Insight:**
> "The most expensive AI mistake is building the wrong solution. Proper problem framing ensures you're solving the right problem with the right approach before investing significant resources." - Technology Strategy Leader

### The Evolution: From GenAI to Agentic AI

Modern AI solutions exist on a spectrum of capabilities and complexity:

| Capability Level | What It Does | Business Example | When to Use |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Simple GenAI** | Creates content in one step | Generate product description from bullet points | Content creation, basic summarization |
| **Conversational GenAI** | Multi-turn dialogue | Customer service chatbot answering questions | Customer support, Q&A systems |
| **GenAI + Tools** | Accesses specific data sources | Answer questions by checking your database | Information retrieval with known sources |
| **Agentic AI** | Multi-step reasoning with multiple tools | Analyze project proposals across departments to find duplicates | Complex workflows, multi-system orchestration |
| **Multi-Agent Systems** | Multiple specialized AI agents working together | Complete business process automation with different experts | Enterprise-wide process transformation |

### Why This Matters for Business

Understanding the AI solution spectrum helps you:

- **Avoid Over-Engineering**: Don't build an expensive agentic system when simple GenAI would work
- **Avoid Under-Engineering**: Don't expect simple GenAI to solve complex multi-system problems
- **Set Realistic Budgets**: More complex solutions cost more to build and operate
- **Plan Appropriate Timelines**: Agentic solutions take longer to develop and test
- **Align Stakeholder Expectations**: Different approaches deliver different capabilities

### The Three-Step Business Framework

GenAI and Agentic AI problem framing consists of three business-focused steps:

1. **Determining the right level of AI solution** for your business problem and expected ROI
2. **Identifying required business systems and data sources** the solution must access
3. **Defining clear business success metrics** that justify the investment

| **Healthcare** | Doctors spend hours on documentation | Reduce clinical documentation time | **Simple GenAI** |
| **Sales** | Sales reps waste time on manual research | Automatically gather and consolidate lead information | **Agentic AI** |
| **Marketing** | Content creation bottleneck | Produce marketing content 10x faster | **Simple GenAI** |
| **HR** | Resume screening is slow and biased | Screen candidates consistently and faster | **Agentic AI** |
| **Finance** | Expense processing takes days | Automate expense categorization and approval | **Agentic AI** |
